For more information on what this project consists of, please refer to the `ipynb` file by running `$ jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb`

# TODO

- [ ] Load datasets
- [ ] Describe dataset using descriptive statistics, i,e: measures of central tendency
- [ ] Describe what I would like to accomplish with this analysis
- [ ] Drop un-necessary features
- [ ] Perform a "naive" model fitting
- [ ] Perform cross validation, using K-folds, to get the best model(out of the same one, tweaking parameters. As in the number of nodes in a decision tree)
- [ ] Fit a final model, check if my accuracy has gotten any better
